  presentation:
    'I entered the world of work in 2018. I was recruited by an IT services company where I stayed for 5 years, and then I worked with a ‘final infrastructure.secondary.client’ for a year. Today, I finally feel ready to become a freelancer. Through various projects, I have developed skills in the professional world as a full-stack developer, and I continuously improve my clean code practices. I have also gained expertise in AWS and even developed a web application from scratch, using various AWS services (WDMAM). I hope we can collaborate together!',
